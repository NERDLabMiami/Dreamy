# Dreamy
## Project Overview
Dreamy is a dating simulator that places the player into conversations with potential suitors where physical appearance matters. The objective of the game is to find a date during a 30 day trial of a dating service. The central game mechanic in the game is choosing how to respond to potential suitors. These conversations highlight the choices and reasons for risk-taking behavior associated with indoor tanning. Components and content in Dreamy are based upon two behavioral prediction models: 

[Integrated Model of Behavioral Prediction](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-19878-008) and the [health belief model](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/109019818401100101?casa_token=TrYC0rlA5D4AAAAA:601ebcXhqI0xb4YsgycOff6s8Er-XPhhph_mODiJsBhmcxvPkH9tvFDC7oW4PaQMpcPWLdhfc_e47A&casa_token=LhDUJjmsWz8AAAAA:aQVrQCbupl2dwkhJ-eUs4QRIEdFU9I9u6_iWnUoDLc-B5jRrruySDcoctFJGWCbWnUug9G4kLIMRhg). The game mechanics have been designed to target salient beliefs and attitudes to determine behavioral intention to engage in tanning behavior and discourage indoor tanning.
